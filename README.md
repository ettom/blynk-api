# blynk-lightswitch
Small python script to interact with the blynk HTTP api.


## Some usage examples:
```
./blynk all off
./blynk all on
./blynk bedroom_light off
./blynk bedroom_light kitchen_light on
./blynk bedroom_light flip
./blynk kitchen_light only
./blynk all status
./blynk all pretty
```

You need to modify the script and add your own devices there.
